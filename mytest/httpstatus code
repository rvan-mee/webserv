405 Method Not Allowed
The request method is known by the server but is not supported by the target resource. For example, an API may not allow calling DELETE to remove a resource.

A server MAY reject a request that contains a message body but not a Content-Length by responding with 411 (Length Required).

if file exists already give error
//  A server that receives a method longer than any that it implements SHOULD respond with a 501 (Not Implemented) 
//  status code. A server that receives a request-target longer than any URI it wishes to parse MUST respond with a 
//  414 (URI Too Long) status code (see Section 15.5.15 of [HTTP]).
// Recipients of an invalid request-line SHOULD respond with either a 400 (Bad Request) error or a 301 (Moved Permanently)
//  redirect with the request-target properly encoded.



// A server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request) status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message that lacks a Host header 
// field and to any request message that contains more than one Host header field line or a Host header field with an 
// invalid field value.

// A server that receives a request header field line, field value, or set of fields larger than it wishes to process MUST 
// respond with an appropriate 4xx (Client Error) status code. Ignoring such header fields would increase the server's 
// vulnerability to request smuggling attacks (Section 11.2 of [HTTP/1.1]).
